= 6.0.16, March 7, 2017 =
* Fixed: Issues related to link tracking.

= 6.0.15, March 7, 2017 =
* Fixed: Issue with translation string numbering in the disabled user group frontend template.
* Fixed: Resolved issue that caused issue with lightbox-style redirects.
* Fixed: Issue where admin pages had JS issues from mis-ordered JS files.

= 6.0.14, March 1, 2017 =
* Tweak: Allow for invalid license to be removed if debug turned on.
* Fixed: Issues with internal links being tracked as internal-as-outbound
* Fixed: Issues with tracking of downloads

= 6.0.13, February 28, 2017 =
* Tweak: Better detection of issues with authentication due to an outdate WP version.
* Fixed: Issue where JS tracking inadvertantly turned on debug mode due to a bad string to boolean conversion.

= 6.0.12, February 27, 2017 =
* New: The JS events tracking has been moved to a new JS file instead of inline. This will offer the same performance as inlining under HTTP/2, but with the benefit of better cache bursting.
* New: Expanded admin adblock detection.
* Tweak: Select2 is now bundled as Select300 in MonsterInsights. We're pulling down the latest copy of Selct2 and then on-the-fly renaming it. This should end any conflicts between our select2 boxes and other plugins/themes.
* Tweak: We've implemented better error detection on the authentication flow. Some users may have previously seen "No profile errors", due to issues with their server setup will now see more accurate errors.
* Tweak: For servers that use PHP Object caching, the cache will now be flushed during the uninstall routines. This should solve a very rare uninstall error.
* Fixed: A "Invalid UA code" error was displayed whenever someone used oAuth2 and then saved the settings panel, despite having a valid UA code.
* Fixed: An issue with the lazyloading of the Google Client for frontend use has been fixed.

= 6.0.11, February 24, 2017 =
* Notice: Version numbers 6.0.5 - 6.0.10 were not used, as we're synching the version numbers of the Lite and Pro versions of our plugin. You didn't miss any updates.
* Notice: As of this release, we no longer backport changes to the old `yst_ga` option. If you need to access MonsterInsights's settings programically, please use our helper functions. Do not directly access a option.
* New: Redesigned authentication dropdown that shows the site urls to make it easier to find a profile when the users have many accounts.
* New: Tracking is now enabled for the WordPress admin login page (wp-login.php).
* Tweak: The Google class in the admin now only checks for blocking when the reauth is attempted. Expect to save a ton of external calls in the admin, and maybe a performance boost.
* Tweak: The GA client object is now lazyloaded on the frontend, so it's loaded only when something (like another plugin) attempts to use it. In plain English, this will make a alot of sites load times significantly improve.
* Tweak: The analytics.js output has been tweaked to be slightly more asthetically pleasing (its aligned correctly). We realize no one probably cares but we look at this code for every user we support, so it help us. 
* Tweak: The config expired notice has been updated to reflect that it can also be shown if the server is blocking MonsterInsights's ability to connect to Google Analytics.
* Tweak: The cron jobs for opt-in tracking and statistics have been combined into a single cron.
* Tweak: Various performance improvements in the frontend output class.
* Tweak: A notice is now shown when MonsterInsights rejects a manual UA code from being saved for being an invalid format.
* Fixed: Issue where the plugin TweetShare would prevent users from being able to see their properties in the authentication dropdown.
* Fixed: Issue where the manual UA code might not be ported as we were backporting changes to the monsterinsights_settings option to the yst_ga option for backwards compatibility. This lead to a situation where the new settings would override the old ones before the routine to fix the manual UA code issue had run.
* Fixed: Issue where a fatal error from a reference to a class called "Yoast_Frontend_GA" which our plugin doesn't have or use, would be shown caused by the previous Yoast usage of object caching via an autoloader. This is solved by doing a 1 time object cache flush on upgrade.
* Fixed: Issue where if you had more than 1000 profiles on your Google account, not all would be shown.
* Fixed: App analytics properties are now excluded from the dropdown of properties you can authenticate to.
* Fixed: The readme suggested a filter to use for filtering the UA to use, but the filter name was typo'd. This has been fixed.
* Fixed: Issue where the tracking cron would add a new unique cron each day.
* Fixed: We implemented a routine to cleanup those extra crons as well as the old yoast one we no longer use.
* Fixed: Issue where the .org theme Schema would prevent users from being able to see their properties in the authentication dropdown.
* Fixed: Issue where JS based events tracking might not correctly track a mailto: link.

= 6.0.4, February 20, 2017 =
* Tweak: monsterinsights_delete_options now checks to ensure an array is passed in
* Tweak: The reporting class now has many more object property checks.
* Fixed: In install if WP version not supported or if MI Pro was active, the plugin attempted to call a property of the plugin object which didn't exist.
* Fixed: In the deactivate/uninstall routines, MI attempted to use a method of a class object which might not exist, as it might not be the active instance. Better instance handling has been added as well as many more exists checks have been added througought the plugin.
* Fixed: Conflicting loads when both MI Pro and Lite are installed. Note, you should only have Pro installed if you want to use it. That being said, we've done extensive testing to ensure we've handled all of the edge cases surrounding this. This could also lead to issues where it would be impossible to remove Lite and/or Pro from a site if both were installed.
* Fixed: Conflicts with the Pinnacle theme, which loads it's CSS file (with overrides to literally all select2 inputs not just the ones it adds) across the entire admin. This lead to an issue where in the Google Auth, a user might not have been able to see (or could appear with wacky styling) the dropdown of profiles to select. If you cannot see this dropdown after authenticating, let us know as its most likely a simple plugin or theme conflict on CSS styling.
* Fixed: The notices to deactivate/uninstall MI Lite/Pro when the other one were installed had an errant extra quotation mark, and they're now more specific about the action to take.
* Fixed: For some users, the setting for user role exclusion was not working. This has been corrected.
* Fixed: A redirect issue that was looping for some users. The code that does this, while working for most, doesn't for some. We've removed it until a full investigation can be completed.

= 6.0.3, February 20, 2017 =
* Fixed: Path for fontawesome font files was incorrect
* Fixed: Notice in the install routine for the $version variable not being set.

= 6.0.2, February 19, 2017 =
* Fixed: Upgrade routine could drop manual UA codes in certain cases. If you upgraded to 6.0.0 or 6.0.1 and it lost the manual UA code, installing this update will automatically restore the UA code entered as long as you haven't used the oAuth or re-entered the manual UA code.

= 6.0.1, February 19, 2017 =
* Fixed: Typo that caused an issue with PHP 7 installs.

= 6.0.0, February 18, 2017 =
* New: Completely overhauled design, from top to bottom. The plugin has been completely rewritten.
* New: **no more advertisements** in the settings pages. We hated them too.
* New: Javascript based event tracking
* New: ga.js is now officially deprecated. New users cannot use it anymore, and existing users can only switch to analytics.js (but not back). Please note, all new features will be developed exclusively for analytics.js. Google has deprecated it, and now we're deprecating our support for it.
* New: License key system now uses the MonsterInsights License management system
* New: Ability to pick which roles can access the dashboard/reports & settings/addons/tools page using our UI. There's also a new custom capability for this (a meta capability)
* New: Support for Google Analytics Master accounts. When you oAuth into MonsterInsights now, the UA view is now locked to what you picked using the brand new oAuth procedure.
* New: Revamped dashboard
* New: Completely new settings system, with a completely new settings page, and a completely new settings API. Also some new hooks and tabs in preparation for the many addons we'll be releasing over the next few months.
* New: No more conflicts between the base plugins
* New: Completely overhauled translation experience. The lite version translations are now fully managed through translations.wordpress.org.
* New: Opt-in to anonymous data so we can better improve MonsterInsights
* New: Significantly better addons page
* New: Single license key to manage all MonsterInsights extensions.
* New: Automatic detection of blocked asset files (from things like un-whitelisted uBlock Origin) with step by step directions on how to easily correct.
* Tweak: Completely overhauled the ga.js and analytics.js outputs to fix outstanding bugs.
* Tweak: Better debugging + disabled + preview tracking modes, that more clearly indicate what's going on 
* Tweak: Completely overhauled PHP regex tracking to solve nearly a dozen outstanding bugs including issues where non-link elements starting with the letter "a" such as <area> tags would get parsed as links causing issues. Also solves issues related to single versus double quote usage for existing onclick handles, non-semicolon terminating onclick handles and various other parsing issues.
* Tweak: Many previously untranslatable strings are now translatable.
* Tweak: Minified in-plugin images.
* Tweak: Minified admin css and js
* Tweak: Uses latest version of Google PHP API now.
* Tweak: The system for creating reports and getting Google Analytics reports have changed. If you've hardcoded into Yoast functions previously not designed for frontend output this could cause problems. We'll introduce an API intended for this type of use after we update to use the v4 reporting API.
* Fix: Fixed an issue with HostEurope and other hosts modifying the default PHP arg seperator.
* Fix: Prevents an issue where users with a plugin like Airplane Mode active will get a better error message than "code invalid" on the GA token auth screen (and also fixes how that detection is done in other parts of the plugin). 
* Removed: unused track_full_url setting

= 5.5.3, October 3rd, 2016 =
* New: Announces MI 6.0 beta.
* Fix: Compatibility with PHP compatibility scanner's bug

= 5.5.2, July 7, 2016 =
* Tweak: Updates license manager to have more reliable update information including better compatibility with Yoast SEO products.

= 5.5.0, May 1, 2016 =
* New: Added new System Info tab for faster support.

* Fix: Issue with eCommerce addon (also requires user to update eCommerce addon)
* Fix: Issue with 2 dashboard links
* Fix: A bug in pre-existing code caused the menu of the plugin to skyrocket unintentionally. This has been corrected.

= 5.4.8, April 14, 2016 =
* New: Google Analytics by Yoast is now MonsterInsights.
* Fix: Compatibility issue with WordPress 4.5
