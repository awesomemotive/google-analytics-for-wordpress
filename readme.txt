* Possibility to ignore any user level and up, so all editors and higher for instance.
* Option to anonymize IP's for use in countries with stricter privacy regulations.
* Tracking of your search result pages and 404 pages.

    * Fixes a small stored XSS issue (only exploitable by admins), thanks [Duncan Stuart](https://twitter.com/DGMStuart) from [DXW security](https://security.dxw.com/) for responsibly disclosing the issue.

* Enhancements:
    * Only allows showing and saving the custom code field for users with the `unfiltered_html` capability.
    * Improves JavaScript output escaping on the frontend.

= 5.4.4 =

Release Date: July 21st, 2015

* Enhancements:
    * Makes sure core functionality is only loaded when needed, improving admin performance and preventing compatibility issues with the upcoming 2.3 release of Yoast SEO.

= 5.4.3 =

Release Date: July 15th, 2015

* Enhancements:
    * Improved form labels for remarketing / demographics and interests reports.
    * Improved the notice that is shown in the head to non-admin users when their usergroup has been excluded from tracking or debug mode is enabled.
    * Adds 4 translations: ca, en_AU, ja, pt_PT

* Bugfixes:
    * Fixes a bug where the plugin would fetch a refresh token from Google on every page request.
    * Fixes an undefined index notice which was triggered when running WordPress using WP CLI.

= 5.4.2 =

Release Date: April 21th, 2015

* Bugfixes:
    * Fixes a bug where our link tracking broke the content in case of multiline links.
    * Fixes a bug where it was no longer possible to dismiss the i18n module.

= 5.4.1 =

Release Date: April 21th, 2015

* Bugfixes:
    * Fixes a bug where GA API was being pinged too often.
    * Fixes a bug where users were unable to authenticate with Google Analytics. It might take a while for authentication to work again, as the API key within the plugin has to be within its quota limits again. We’re very sorry for the inconvenience. Note that for Premium users everything still works.

= 5.4 =

Release Date: April 20th, 2015

* Enhancements:
    * Complete technical overhaul of the way settings are being stored. Switched to WP Settings API and added input validation and sanitation for several settings.
    * Made the settings more accessible by adding `for` attributes to the labels, connecting them with the corresponding form fields. Props to [Steve Repsher](https://github.com/steverep) for the awesome contribution!
    * Made Universal tracking the default for new installs.
    * Adds administrators to the default user roles to ignore for tracking.

* Security:
    * Fixes several security issues that were discovered during an elaborate security review performed by our friends from [Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/).
    * Fixes two other XSS issues. Thanks to [Johannes Schmitt](https://github.com/schmittjoh) from [Scrutinizer CI](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/) and [Jouko Pynnönen](http://klikki.fi) for discovering and responsibly disclosing these issues.

* Bugfixes:
    * Fixes an issue where some GA dashboard style sheets and scripts were also loaded outside of the Google Analytics by Yoast dashboard, thereby unnecessarily slowing down the WP admin.
    * Fixes a bug where a PHP warning could be raised on the dashboard when no data is available.

= 5.3.3 =

Release Date: March 19th, 2015

* Several security fixes:
    1. Fix minor XSS issue where admins could XSS each other through an unescaped manual UA field.
    1. Fix stored XSS issue where changing a property's name in Google Analytics to contain malicious JS would allow execution of that JS in the admin as the profile name was not escaped properly.
    1. Fix un-authenticated change of the GA profile list, allowing the previous XSS to become a slightly bigger issue. Issues 2 and 3 combined lead to a [DREAD score](http://blog.sucuri.net/2015/03/understanding-wordpress-plugin-vulnerabilities.html) of 5.
* Other fixes:
    * Small code style improvements.
    * Throw an error and deactivate if either the PHP SPL or PHP filter libraries aren't loaded.
    * Introduced a filter `yst_ga_track_super_admin` to allow disabling of super admin tracking on multi-site, defaulting to true.

Big thanks to [Jouko Pynnönen](http://klikki.fi) for responsibly disclosing security issues #2 and #3.

* Bugfixes:
	* Fixes a bug where GA profile was fetched with every admin request, resulting in a pile of unnecessary API requests.
	* Fixes a problem where GA started throttling API requests done by our plugin because there were too many. We now fetch the data only once a day from GA. For realtime data, users should go to Google Analytics.

* Added support for cross-domain tracking.
* Fixed various small bugs.

= 4.1.3 =

	* Changed access level from "edit_users" to "manage_options" so super-admins in an multi site environment would be able to access.
	* Not a real bug but a fix nonetheless: UA ID is now trimmed on output, so spaces accidently entered in the settings screen won't prevent tracking.
	* Changed double quotes in link tracking output to single quotes to resolve incompatibilities with several plugins.

= 4.0.6 =
* Bugs fixed in this release:
	* Sanitizing relative URL's could go wrong on some blogs installed in subdirectories.
	* Comment form tracking only worked for posts, not for pages, and would sometimes cause other issues. Patch by [Milan Dinić](http://blog.milandinic.com/).
	* Settings page: now correctly hiding internal links to track as outbound block when outbound link tracking is disabled.
* Code sanitization:
	* Hardcoded the [scope for custom variables](http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/gaJS/gaJSApiBasicConfiguration.html#_gat.GA_Tracker_._setCustomVar) to prevent that from possibly going wrong.

= 4.0.5 =
* New features in this release:
	* Added a simple check to see if the UA code, when entered manually, matches a basic pattern of UA-1234567-12.
	* Added integration with [W3 Total Cache](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/w3-total-cache/) and [WP Super Cache](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-super-cache/). The page cache is now automatically cleared after updating settings. Caching is recommended for all WordPress users, as faster page loads improve tracking reliability and W3 Total Cache is our recommended caching plugin.
	* Added the option to enter a manual location for ga.js, allowing you to host it locally should you wish to.
* Bugs fixed:
	* Fixed implementation of _anonymizeIp, it now correctly anonymizes IP's by setting [_gat._anonymizeIp](http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/gaJS/gaJSApi_gat.html#_gat._anonymizeIp).
	* Increased request timeout time for Google Analytics authentication from 10 to 20 seconds, for slow hosts (if this fixes it for you, your hosting is probably not really good, consider another WordPress host).
* Documentation fixes:
	* Added a note about profiles with the same UA code to the Analytics Profile selection.
	* The profile selection dropdown now shows the UA code after the profile name too.
	* Updated the [screenshots](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/google-analytics-for-wordpress/screenshots/) and the [FAQ](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/google-analytics-for-wordpress/faq/) for this plugin.

= 4.0.4 =

= 4.0.3 =
* New features in this release:
	* Added versioning to the options array, to allow for easy addition of options.
	* Added an option to enable comment form tracking (as this loads jQuery), defaults to on.
* Bugs fixed:
	* If you upgraded from before 4.0 to 4.0.2 you might have an empty value for ignore_userlevel in some edge cases, this is now fixed.
	* Custom search engines were loaded after trackPageview, this was wrong as shown [by these docs](http://code.google.com/intl/sr/apis/analytics/docs/tracking/asyncMigrationExamples.html#SearchEngines), now fixed.

= 4.0.2 =
* Old settings from versions below 4.0 are now properly sanitized and inherited (slaps forehead about simplicity of fix).
* New features in this release:
	* Link sanitization added: relative links will be rewritten to absolute, so /out/ becomes http://example.com/out/ and is tracked properly.
	* Added a feature to track and label internal links as outbound clicks, for instance /out/ links.
	* Added tracking for mailto: links.
	* Added a filter for text-widgets, all links in those widgets are now tagged too.
	* Added support for [_anonymizeIp](http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/gaJS/gaJSApi_gat.html#_gat._anonymizeIp).
