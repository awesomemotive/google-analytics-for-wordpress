= Google Analytics Dashboard + Real Time Stats =

Our goal at MonsterInsights is to make analytics easy and accessible for everyone.

We understand that Google Analytics has a steep learning curve which often prevents small business owners from making informed decisions to grow their business.

That's why MonsterInsights comes with a built-in Google Analytics Dashboard for your WordPress site, so you can see all the useful information about your visitors right inside your WordPress dashboard.

We have created customized Google Analytics reports to help you filter through the noise and see the stats that really matter!

* **Audience Report** helps you get to know your visitors in a whole new way. It shows you detailed insights like which country your visitors are coming from, what are they most interested in, which device are they using, their age, gender, and a whole lot more. You can use this demographics report and audience clues to tweak your website design and content accordingly.

* **Behavior Report** shows you exactly how people find your website, which keywords did they search for, who referred them, what did they click on your site, and more. You can use these useful stats to identify low-hanging fruits, new partnership opportunities, and promotional areas to focus on.

* **Content Report** shows you stats on exactly which content gets the most visits, so you can stop guessing and start creating content that gets more traffic and conversion.

* **Ecommerce Report** shows you important store stats like total revenue, conversion rate, average order value, top referral sources, and more (all in one place).

* **Forms Report** shows you conversion stats for various contact forms and lead forms on your website, so you can improve the conversions to grow your business.

* **Search Console Report** shows you exactly how well your website is ranking in Google, so you can further optimize your SEO to grow your organic traffic.

* **Custom Dimensions Report** helps you dig deeper by showing you useful stats like who are your most popular authors, what are the best publication times, which are your most popular categories or tags, how well are your Yoast focus keywords and SEO score performing, and more.

* **Site Speed Report** makes it easy to track loading times for your website and get the information you need to improve.

Our custom Google Analytics Dashboard reports are based on over 12+ years of online business experience. We built MonsterInsights to be the Google Analytics plugin that we wish we had.

We currently use MonsterInsights on all our portfolio companies which include both media sites generating tens of millions of pageviews and eCommerce sites generating millions in sales.

- New: We've added a new welcome screen for first time MonsterInsights users that makes it easier than ever to get started with our plugin.
- New: We've added a pair of health checks to the WordPress core site health area to help make it even easier than ever to know that your MonsterInsights install is working properly.
- Tweak: We've added more GA error code detection to help our users when their access tokens expire due to Google's token expiration guidelines.
- Tweak: We've adjusted some of the wording of settings in the plugin to make them clearer.
- Tweak: You can now toggle the dashboard widget on/off directly from the dashboard widget (can also still be done in the Screen Options).
- Tweak: We've added a link on the dashboard widget to bring you directly to the full Overview report.
- Tweak: We've spent some time adding more checks and more verbose error messages whenever we show a user an error message. It rarely happens, but if we can make them more helpful when they do, everyone wins.
- Tweak: We've ensured the menu items look good regardless of the WordPress admin color scheme used.
- Fixed: While MonsterInsights does not track site administrators by default in order to prevent unintended skewing of the Google Analytics data by site owners, we've fixed a bug that prevented users from being able to track them if they wanted to.
- Fixed: While we strongly recommend connecting with MonsterInsights since that allows the Reports and some of the more powerful MonsterInsights features to work, we've fixed a bug where if a manual UA code was added it was not removable on the mulitisite network panel due to a bug in the validation of that field.
- Fixed: We fixed an issue where on the network admin area of WordPress sites, if the plugin SG Optimizer plugin was installed, their plugin's CSS would mess up our plugin's menu item icon.
- Fixed: With our plugin's conversion to VueJS complete, we've removed some old stylesheet and javascript files from the admin that are no longer needed.
- Fixed: Sometimes the current screen was not set in the onboarding wizard so we've added some logic to ensure it's always set for consistency.
- Fixed: Javascript translations for the admin bar widget were sometimes loaded even if the admin bar widget was not going to load itself due to settings.
- Fixed: We've fixed a couple spelling errors in the plugin.

- Fixed: Missing image file added.

= 7.4.1: January 16, 2019 =
- Fixed: WordPress Core currently has a bug (18857) that affects a super small percentage of our userbase (under 3%) that we've patched our plugin for until WordPress can get a fix shipped in a release.

= 7.4.0: January 15, 2019 =
- New: Brand new settings panel written in VueJS! The new panel has been designed to simplify the process of setting up MonsterInsights and make MonsterInsights's powerful features more user friendly to use.
- New: Brand new onboarding wizard that walks you through setting up MonsterInsights and automatically configures your MonsterInsights settings based on your website needs in just a few minutes.
- New: Users using the affiliate link tracking feature will find they can now define a custom label for each link they want to track, and it's all validated in a new custom repeater field.
- New: Significant performance improvements on both the admin and frontend side of things. This is best exemplified by the new settings panel, which loads significantly faster than the previous one.
- New: MonsterInsights's support staff often sees users who have upgraded to using MonsterInsights from other Google Analytics plugins (or even worse hardcoded tracking code), and forget to turn off the old tracking code. MonsterInsights will now automatically detect most of those other tracking codes and let you know so you get the most accurate tracking numbers from the start.
- Tweak: We've gone through the whole settings area and rewrote the labels for each setting to make them more clear as to what they do.
- Tweak: Based on our opt-in usage tracking data (thank you by the way for those that opt into it), we've removed a couple of the settings that nearly all users had enabled/disabled to make the panel even more simple and useful.
- Tweak: Javascript conflicts with other plugins aren't fun, so we've spent a ton of time testing with hundreds of plugins for this release, and changing our internal code to make it harder for plugin authors not following WordPress best practices to conflict with our code. We've been putting the data from the opt-in usage tracking system to test all of the top plugins and themes that our users run (and we'll continue to do this moving forward).
- Tweak: As part of our ongoing mission to make MonsterInsights accessible for all, we've spent a large amount of this release building out significant tooling for accessibility issue detection, and fixing any issues we have found on the new settings panel. We're going to continue to work on ensuring MonsterInsights is not just the best Google Analytics plugin for WordPress but also the most accessible, and in future releases you'll see even more compatibility updates for this.
- Tweak: For users who are using the "light" admin color scheme, you'll notice our menu icon now adapts to it automatically.
- Removed: MonsterInsights's debug mode has been removed. Originally designed as a tool for our support staff to use when helping users we found that we internally were not using it once we started using more powerful browser extensions, so to reduce user confusion (since it is not designed for use by users), we've removed it.
- Removed: We've removed a bunch of long deprecated PHP constants, filters, and  functions, and streamlined the install routines to make MonsterInsights even faster.

= 7.3.3: December 31, 2018 =
- Tweak: Adjusted authentication compatibility checks to allow for more accurate checking.
- Fixed: Issue where the save button might not appear for the network settings panel.
- Fixed: Added compatibility shims for a couple plugins.

= 7.3.2: November 27, 2018 =
- Fixed: Issue on some Lite installs where timezone differences caused users to see an error related to custom date ranges.
- Fixed: Issue where some users were unable to reauthenticate their site.

= 7.3.0: October 30, 2018 =
- New: We've added new custom link attribution, so now you can easily set custom link categories, actions, and labels, which MonsterInsights will use with precedence over our comprehensive automatic link detection, and is compatible with our AMP addon. For usage instructions, see our documentation on <a href="https://www.monsterinsights.com/docs/custom-link-attribution/">custom link attribution</a>.
- Tweak: Better error handling for reports.
- Fixed: Issue where on MonsterInsights pages, the dropdowns on the WP admin menu might not work.
- Fixed: Compatibility for Writee theme, YouTube by EmbedPlus plugin, Blog Time plugin, MaterialWP plugin and Swifty Image Widget plugin.
- Fixed: Issue where on a network install of multisite, all sites might not de-authenticate on removal.
- Fixed: Compatibility issue with Microsoft Edge and IE browsers where the table on overview report might overflow.
- Fixed: On certain browsers when the browser screen width is small the graph tooltips might have appeared off-center.

= 7.2.0: September 19, 2018 =
- Tweak: Sites with large traffic will see numbers larger than 1 million abbreviated so the numbers will no longer overflow out of the report container boxes.
- Tweak: We've clarified the download tracking setting to point out that externally hosted downloads are now tracked as downloads, not external links.
- Tweak: Compatibility for the Fix WP Tables and Magee Shortcodes
- Fixed: We've fixed issues where sites that were recreated/migrated sometimes could not re-authenticate with MonsterInsights.

= 7.1.0: August 8, 2018 =

- Fixed: Undefined $tracking variable error.
- Fixed: Better type checking before converting number strings to human readable dates on reports.
- Fixed: If GA didn't load and link tracking was enabled, an undefined Javascript error could occur if the fallback object didn't get set (edgecase).

= 7.0.5: April 9, 2018 =
- New: Introduced a system (behind-the-scenes) that automatically attempts to correct for improperly set timezones in the WordPress settings panel, server timezone settings and/or GA profile timezones. This should eliminate issues with timezones on Lite user accounts, as well as allow for more accurate date reporting.
- New: Introduced a system (behind-the-scenes) to allow for deauthentication of profiles set on websites whose profiles were migrated (for example from a staging site to a production site)
- Tweak: Made clientID retrieval more efficient.
- Fixed: Several translation/textdomain and typo fixes.
- Fixed: Undefined $num in the overview report.

= 7.0.4: March 7, 2018 =
- New: We've added links to the pages listed in the top pages part of the Overview report to make it easier to see which page each title belongs to.
- New: We've added the UA code to the account selector to make it easier to determine which property to use.
- New: Better compatibility with IE11.
- New: The links to view more reporting data now default to the currently selected daterange when you go to analytics.google.com
- Fixed: We've corrected some missing closing li tags on the overview report.
- Fixed: We fixed an issue where get_current_screen might be undefined on some pages.
- Fixed: We fixed an issue where some improperly configured servers might resolve symlinks that are not supposed to be resolved, leading to issues with loading asset files MonsterInsights uses.

= 7.0.3: February 28, 2018 =
- New: We added support for tracking download files that have a cache busting variable on the URL.
- New: We added support for the new UserID mode used in our AMP addon.
- Tweak: We fixed a bug with the notices class, and drastically cut back on the number of them.
- Fixed: We fixed a bug with our Facebook Instant Articles addon that prevented some users from being tracked for downloads.
- Fixed: We fixed a bug in the usage tracking for some types of installs.
- Fixed: We've allowed the disabling of tracking for admininistrator role users on single sites.

= 7.0.2: February 27, 2018 =
- Fixed: Fixed a bug with the analytics.js output where a UA code wasn't entered, the $reason variable could be undefined.
- Fixed: Fixed an issue where a notice might not be dismissable and we've also removed several of them.

= 7.0.1: February 26, 2018 =
- New: Support for the updated version of MonsterInsights AMP plugin which switches from using a custom REST endpoint to using the now built in Google AMP ClientID synching feature. If you're using the AMP addon, you'll want to also update that addon as well.
- New: The __gaTracker and disable tracking functions will always be defined, even when we're not tracking users (for example if viewing a preview, or if a logged-in administrator) to allow sites to not have to worry about breakage when variable exist checking isn't done.
- New: We now output a notice in the console and output the GA code (though do not run it) when we're not tracking someone. This makes it easier to verify the Google code is indeed outputting, and also makes it more clear as to why a particular user isn't being tracked. Note, when testing Google Analytics code, always do it logged out, ideally in the private browsing/incognito mode of your web browser. We're going to keep working on improving the frontend system to simplify it and add new features for both Lite and Pro users now that we've jettisoned ga.js support in MonsterInsights 7.0. You'll see updates through the year that add new tracking features, particularly ones that we're tweaking in order to expand and refine our built-in reporting.
- New: We added a "have a MonsterInsights license" link on the settings panel, to make it clearer the procedure for the quick and easy upgrade from MonsterInsights Lite to MonsterInsights Pro.
- Tweak: We removed the phrase referencing the dashboard (removed in MonsterInsights 7.0) from the permissions settings.
- Fixed: Due to us forgetting to include our jQuery shim for disable() in the Lite, some users were unable to use the 10/25/50 expand feature on the reports page.
- Fixed: An accidental use of the PHP function date instead of the one called time meant that some users were unable to see updated reporting data each day in the Lite version.
- Fixed: In sitei() in the api-auth class, we used mb_strimwidth to trim the final string to 30 characters. While this is a great PHP function, not all servers have the mbstring (Multibyte String) PHP extension installed, from which all mb_* functions are provided, despite it being a "required" PHP extension to use WordPress core. This caused some servers to be unable to authenticate and thus get our amazing new reports (sad face). This usage has been replaced with a standard substr use, thus allowing for compatibility with all servers.

= 7.0.0: February 20, 2018 =
* New: Completely revamped reports with a new UI.
* New: Ability to oAuth at the network level, and have that oAuth apply as the default to all subsites (can still override at a subsite level).
* New: Ability to enter a license key at the network level, and have that oAuth apply as the default to all subsites (can still override at a subsite level).
* New: Completely new oAuth flow, that handles more errors and allows for future growth. Importantly, your existing sites will continue to track (the UA code is manually moved in the upgrade process), but you will need to re-authenticate (a quicker, and even easier process in 7.0) to enable our all new reporting area. New permissions requested to allow for significantly expanded reporting (and some upcoming reports).
* New: Ability to see the site traffic graphs in both pageviews and sessions.
* New: You can now choose between Last 30 days, Last 7 days, or any date range of your choosing if you're a paid MonsterInsights user!
* New: Compare site traffic to the previous period.
* New: Completely revamped overview report. You'll find lots of new data has been added. Also, all of that data changes as you use change the date ranges (a Pro exclusive feature).
* New: A brand new eCommerce report for Pro users
* New: A brand new Search Console/Queries report for paid MonsterInsights users. This allows you to see which terms you are ranking for on Google and how Google searches are driving your site traffic, along with clickthrough rates.
* New: A brand new Publishers report for Plus level users allowing you to see breakdown of important site metrics.
* New: A lot of behind the scenes work enabling more reports to be added in the future. Stay on the lookout as we start significantly expanding the breadth and depth of reporting this year.
* New: A revised general settings panel which is significantly faster to load.
* New: Significant performance improvements. We completely top-to-bottom audited MonsterInsights. It's now 286% faster in the admin and 161% faster in the frontend.
* New: Completely new internal notification handling has been implemented. This should make it clearer if you need to address anything, and if so make it less tedious to figure out exactly what.
* Tweak: We've changed the verbage for what users see if they are logged in as a site administrator on the frontend to make it more clear MonsterInsights doesn't track site administrators to prevent them from skewing their own Google Analytics data (particularly demographics data) and to encourage them to use the Incognito Mode/Private browsing mode of their web browser (or log out) if they want to view the Google Analytics code.
* Tweak: The URL used for the measurement protocol calls has been updated per Google guidance.
* Tweak: We've discovered some strings that weren't translatable, and fixed that.
* Tweak: Based on your feedback, we've clarified the titles and descriptions used in some of the settings to make it more clear as to what they do.
* Tweak: When first adding a license key, in rare cases sometimes the addons permissions didn't sync. While extremely rare, and while MonsterInsights would automatically fix itself within 6 hours, we've added a system that eliminates this from happening, and made sure that there's also a way to fix this manually if this need arises.
* Tweak: The countries map has been changed to a countries list (sorted). This means we can remove jVectorMap which had some issues in mapping, and also make it easier for you to see your top countries data.
* Removed: Support for the long deprecated ga.js tracking has been removed. We've had dismissable (and then later non-dismissable) persistent admin notices for over a year now, and it's time to remove support for these finally. Analytics.js tracking is far more accurate than ga.js tracking. Users of ga.js were not able to take advantage of new MonsterInsights features and Google Analytics features that relied on analytics.js, including our out-of-the-box Javascript based events tracking system, and many other features (like enhanced eCommerce tracking in our eCommerce addon). Google themselves deprecated ga.js over 5 years ago. On update, we'll automatically move those using ga.js to analytics.js. This switch requires no changes on behalf of the site owner.
* Removed: Support for the long deprecated PHP events tracking has been removed. We've had dismissable (and then later non-dismissable) persistent admin notices for over a year now offering a 1 click update. The PHP events tracking, a stayover from the Yoast years, caused a lot of issues and couldn't track everything on a page. It could only track things in specific WordPress areas like the_content and widgets, but couldn't track anything outside of that, or things that were added to the DOM after WordPress rendered the page. Our JS events tracking system can track all-the-things on all parts of a page, and is far more accurate and easier for us to maintain. Maintaining a gigantic PHP regex-based system took a lot of our development time up, and based on our opt-in tracking data, almost no one uses it anymore (which is good, because JS tracking is so much better). Users still using it will be automatically switched to JS events tracking on update (which requires no changes to switch to using it).
* Removed: Many deprecated filters from the Yoast era have been removed. After maintaining backwards compatibility for over a year now, and also issuing a notice every time those deprecated filters were used, it's time to pull the plug on these to allow our tracking system to be able to be simplified in the future. We have a complete document in our documentation for the 6.0 release that details exactly how to update for each of these filters.

* Notice: As of this release, we no longer backport changes to the old `yst_ga` option. If you need to access MonsterInsights's settings programically, please use our helper functions. Do not directly access a option.
* New: Redesigned authentication dropdown that shows the site urls to make it easier to find a profile when the users have many accounts.
* New: Tracking is now enabled for the WordPress admin login page (wp-login.php).
* Tweak: The Google class in the admin now only checks for blocking when the reauth is attempted. Expect to save a ton of external calls in the admin, and maybe a performance boost.
* Tweak: The GA client object is now lazyloaded on the frontend, so it's loaded only when something (like another plugin) attempts to use it. In plain English, this will make a alot of sites load times significantly improve.
* Tweak: The analytics.js output has been tweaked to be slightly more aesthetically pleasing (its aligned correctly). We realize no one probably cares but we look at this code for every user we support, so it help us.
* Tweak: The config expired notice has been updated to reflect that it can also be shown if the server is blocking MonsterInsights's ability to connect to Google Analytics.
* Tweak: The cron jobs for opt-in tracking and statistics have been combined into a single cron.
* Tweak: Various performance improvements in the frontend output class.
* Tweak: A notice is now shown when MonsterInsights rejects a manual UA code from being saved for being an invalid format.
* Fixed: Issue where the plugin TweetShare would prevent users from being able to see their properties in the authentication dropdown.
* Fixed: Issue where the manual UA code might not be ported as we were backporting changes to the monsterinsights_settings option to the yst_ga option for backwards compatibility. This lead to a situation where the new settings would override the old ones before the routine to fix the manual UA code issue had run.
* Fixed: Issue where a fatal error from a reference to a class called "Yoast_Frontend_GA" which our plugin doesn't have or use, would be shown caused by the previous Yoast usage of object caching via an autoloader. This is solved by doing a 1 time object cache flush on upgrade.
* Fixed: Issue where if you had more than 1000 profiles on your Google account, not all would be shown.
* Fixed: App analytics properties are now excluded from the dropdown of properties you can authenticate to.
* Fixed: The readme suggested a filter to use for filtering the UA to use, but the filter name was typo'd. This has been fixed.
* Fixed: Issue where the tracking cron would add a new unique cron each day.
* Fixed: We implemented a routine to cleanup those extra crons as well as the old yoast one we no longer use.
* Fixed: Issue where the .org theme Schema would prevent users from being able to see their properties in the authentication dropdown.
* Fixed: Issue where JS based events tracking might not correctly track a mailto: link.

= 6.0.4, February 20, 2017 =
* Tweak: monsterinsights_delete_options now checks to ensure an array is passed in
* Tweak: The reporting class now has many more object property checks.
* Fixed: In install if WP version not supported or if MI Pro was active, the plugin attempted to call a property of the plugin object which didn't exist.
* Fixed: In the deactivate/uninstall routines, MI attempted to use a method of a class object which might not exist, as it might not be the active instance. Better instance handling has been added as well as many more exists checks have been added througought the plugin.
* Fixed: Conflicting loads when both MI Pro and Lite are installed. Note, you should only have Pro installed if you want to use it. That being said, we've done extensive testing to ensure we've handled all of the edge cases surrounding this. This could also lead to issues where it would be impossible to remove Lite and/or Pro from a site if both were installed.
* Fixed: Conflicts with the Pinnacle theme, which loads it's CSS file (with overrides to literally all select2 inputs not just the ones it adds) across the entire admin. This lead to an issue where in the Google Auth, a user might not have been able to see (or could appear with wacky styling) the dropdown of profiles to select. If you cannot see this dropdown after authenticating, let us know as its most likely a simple plugin or theme conflict on CSS styling.
* Fixed: The notices to deactivate/uninstall MI Lite/Pro when the other one were installed had an errant extra quotation mark, and they're now more specific about the action to take.
* Fixed: For some users, the setting for user role exclusion was not working. This has been corrected.
* Fixed: A redirect issue that was looping for some users. The code that does this, while working for most, doesn't for some. We've removed it until a full investigation can be completed.

= 6.0.3, February 20, 2017 =
* Fixed: Path for fontawesome font files was incorrect
* Fixed: Notice in the install routine for the $version variable not being set.

= 6.0.2, February 19, 2017 =
* Fixed: Upgrade routine could drop manual UA codes in certain cases. If you upgraded to 6.0.0 or 6.0.1 and it lost the manual UA code, installing this update will automatically restore the UA code entered as long as you haven't used the oAuth or re-entered the manual UA code.

= 6.0.1, February 19, 2017 =
* Fixed: Typo that caused an issue with PHP 7 installs.

= 6.0.0, February 18, 2017 =
* New: Completely overhauled design, from top to bottom. The plugin has been completely rewritten.
* New: **no more advertisements** in the settings pages. We hated them too.
* New: Javascript based event tracking
* New: ga.js is now officially deprecated. New users cannot use it anymore, and existing users can only switch to analytics.js (but not back). Please note, all new features will be developed exclusively for analytics.js. Google has deprecated it, and now we're deprecating our support for it.
* New: License key system now uses the MonsterInsights License management system
* New: Ability to pick which roles can access the dashboard/reports & settings/addons/tools page using our UI. There's also a new custom capability for this (a meta capability)
* New: Support for Google Analytics Master accounts. When you oAuth into MonsterInsights now, the UA view is now locked to what you picked using the brand new oAuth procedure.
* New: Revamped dashboard
* New: Completely new settings system, with a completely new settings page, and a completely new settings API. Also some new hooks and tabs in preparation for the many addons we'll be releasing over the next few months.
* New: No more conflicts between the base plugins
* New: Completely overhauled translation experience. The lite version translations are now fully managed through translations.wordpress.org.
* New: Opt-in to anonymous data so we can better improve MonsterInsights
* New: Significantly better addons page
* New: Single license key to manage all MonsterInsights extensions.
* New: Automatic detection of blocked asset files (from things like un-whitelisted uBlock Origin) with step by step directions on how to easily correct.
* Tweak: Completely overhauled the ga.js and analytics.js outputs to fix outstanding bugs.
* Tweak: Better debugging + disabled + preview tracking modes, that more clearly indicate what's going on
* Tweak: Completely overhauled PHP regex tracking to solve nearly a dozen outstanding bugs including issues where non-link elements starting with the letter "a" such as <area> tags would get parsed as links causing issues. Also solves issues related to single versus double quote usage for existing onclick handles, non-semicolon terminating onclick handles and various other parsing issues.
* Tweak: Many previously untranslatable strings are now translatable.
* Tweak: Minified in-plugin images.
* Tweak: Minified admin css and js
* Tweak: Uses latest version of Google PHP API now.
* Tweak: The system for creating reports and getting Google Analytics reports have changed. If you've hardcoded into Yoast functions previously not designed for frontend output this could cause problems. We'll introduce an API intended for this type of use after we update to use the v4 reporting API.
* Fixed: Fixed an issue with HostEurope and other hosts modifying the default PHP arg seperator.
* Fixed: Prevents an issue where users with a plugin like Airplane Mode active will get a better error message than "code invalid" on the GA token auth screen (and also fixes how that detection is done in other parts of the plugin).
* Removed: unused track_full_url setting

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

For all frequently asked questions, and their answers, check the [MonsterInsights Knowledge base](https://www.monsterinsights.com/docs/).

= Why use Google Analytics vs WordPress stats? =

Native WordPress stats plugin will always slow down your website because they rely on your WordPress hosting server. Most of them do not provide accurate WordPress analytics either.

Some WordPress stats plugin use third-party servers to mitigate this issue, but they all lack powerful features that Google Analytics can offer.

Google Analytics is the #1 analytics solution in the world. It comes with all the powerful features that you can ever ask for. MonsterInsights makes it easy for you to use all advanced Google Analytics features in WordPress.

= Can I use MonsterInsights together with another Google Analytics plugin? =

No. You should only use one Google Analytics plugin on your WordPress site. If you use multiple Google Analytics plugins, then you will compromise your data integrity. It will skew your data and you might see inflated stats.

We recommend uninstalling other Google Analytics plugins before you install MonsterInsights.

= Why does MonsterInsights load Google Analytics in WordPress header section? =

Some people believe that loading Google Analytics in WordPress header will slow down your website. That's a myth. Google Analytics loads asynchronously which means that it does not impact your website speed at all.

MonsterInsights load Google Analytics code in WordPress header because it makes sure that you have the most accurate tracking.
